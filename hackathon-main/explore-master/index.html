        <h2>Mythology</h2>
        <p class="text-black">Sexual ambivalence has been a recurring motif in figures populating the 
          world of ancient Indian mythology. Tales in regional folklore as well as
           the epic texts refer to both deities and heroes as well as non-divine 
          figures changing genders
          , or manifesting as avatars of the opposite sex, such as Adhanari or Ardhaniswara, one of Shiva's most popular avatars who is half-man and half-woman
          . In Vedic literature, the Kama Sutra, too, has spoken of the various branches of the queer community
          Another myth tells of a king who prayed to the Goddess for a son, who 
          was eventually born impotent. The prince, Jetho, dreamt of Bahuchara one
           day who ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and 
          become her servant. Bahuchara Mata has consistently, over these stories,
           appeared as a figure who identified impotent men and commanded them to 
          do this and serve her. If they refused to assume the attire and 
          mannerisms of the opposite gender, they would be cursed in their next 
          seven incarnations to be born impotent, and thus the cult of devotees 
          who worship Bahuchara Mata grew; a community that is required to self-castrate and remain celibate
          .
           The stories also speak of the conflict between body and soul that 
          transgenders go through, in search for their gender identity, a story 
          from ancient times reflecting their state of mind.</p>

          <ul><li>GBTQ scientists in STEM fields report more negative workplace
experiences than their counterparts in other industries or non-LGBTQ
scientists in STEM. LGBTQ scientists are also more likely to leave STEM
fields at higher rates than non-LGBTQ scientists.</li>

<li>Among LGBT youth, mental health issues stemming from rejection are
at alarming levels. According to a research study done by the Family
Acceptance Project (San Francisco State University), compared to teens
who have not faced rejection LGBT teens who have faced rejection from
their families/ caregivers/ peers are six times more likely to report
high levels of depression, six times more likely to experiment with
drugs, and eight times more likely to commit suicide. Approximately
30-40% of all LGBT youth who have faced rejection on account of being
LGBT have attempted suicide. 
</li>
<li>
Homelessness among LGBT youth is extremely high compared to the
rest of the population. According to a study by the UCLA School of Law
LGBT youth make up approximately 35-40% of homeless youth, despite
constituting only about 5% of the overall youth cohort. 
</li>
<li>
According to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) one in five LGBT college students fear for their physical safety due to their
gender identity or their perceived sexual orientation.
</li>
<li>
According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network
(GLSEN) only about 2-5% of college athletes are out. According to the
Executive Director of GLSEN, there are two major minefields in coming
out: the potential to face ridicule and lose support of teammates and
peers; and the loss of financial and personal support from the coach.
</li>
<li>
Campus Pride has released an index of colleges and universities
based on their LGBT friendliness, based on a survey of 50+ questions,
corresponding to 8 different LGBT-friendly factors. These factors are:
policy inclusion; support & institutional commitment; academic life; student life; housing; campus safety; counseling & health; and
recruitment & retention efforts.
